# LegalInsight: Comprehensive Legal Strategy and Judgment Analysis

LegalInsight is an advanced Streamlit web application designed to simplify legal document analysis for professionals, researchers, and students. By uploading a legal document in PDF format, users can generate summaries, retrieve relevant past judgments, and receive strategic insights to guide judicial decisions. The app also includes a "Chat with PDF" feature that allows users to interact with the document through a conversational interface.

## Features Overview

### PDF Upload
Upload any legal document in PDF format. LegalInsight supports chargesheets, case files, legal briefs, and more.

### Document Summary Generation
Automatically generate concise summaries of uploaded legal documents using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP).

### Judgment Retrieval
Retrieve past judgments from similar cases, aiding in understanding precedents and preparing for court proceedings.

### Strategic Insights
LegalInsight suggests potential strategies and actions based on the uploaded document, leveraging AI to analyze legal principles and past judgments.

### Chat with PDF
The "Chat with PDF" feature allows users to interactively ask questions about the uploaded document, providing specific details and clarifications in real-time.

## Updates: Local LLM and Demo Access
LegalInsight now supports running processes locally to maintain privacy. Users can download Ollama for local LLM use, ensuring that data stays private. A demo is also available at: [LegalInsight Demo](https://legal-insight.streamlit.app/).

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Ollama (optional, for local use)
- Together API Key (for using external APIs)

### Step-by-Step Installation for Local Use

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone the LegalInsight repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KeshavG69/LegalInsight.git
   cd LegalInsight
   ```

   **Activate virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv virtual
   ```

   ```bash
   source virtual/bin/activate
   ```

      or for Windows-based machines -
   ```bash
   .\virtual\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**



   You can install Tesseract and Poppler using Homebrew with the following command:
   ### MacOS
   ```bash
   brew install tesseract poppler
   ```
   
   ### Linux
   
   For Ubuntu or Debian systems, you can install Tesseract and Poppler using `apt-get` with the following command:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr poppler-utils
   ```


   Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download and Set Up Ollama (for Local Use)**
   If you want to run LegalInsight with local LLM models, download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download).

5. **Create a `.env` File**
   Create a `.env` file in the `local_code` directory and add your Together API key:
   ```
   TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_api_key_here
   ```
   This key is necessary for using external APIs to retrieve additional information or for document analysis.

6. **Run the Streamlit Application Locally**
   Run the application locally by executing:
   ```bash
   cd local_code
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   The application will launch in your default web browser. If it doesn't, manually open `http://localhost:8501`.

### For Online Use (No Local Setup Required)
If you just want to test the app without setting it up locally, you can access it directly via the hosted version here: [LegalInsight Demo](https://legal-insight.streamlit.app/).

## File Structure

- **`src/`**: This folder hosts the code for the online demo of LegalInsight. **You do not need to interact with this folder** unless you are the maintainer hosting the web version.
- **`local_code/`**: Contains scripts for running LegalInsight entirely locally, ensuring privacy and local processing. This is the folder users should use for running the app on their local machine.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Located in the root directory, this file contains all the required dependencies for running the application.

## Technical Details

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
LegalInsight uses pre-trained language models from the `transformers` library for legal document analysis. For local use, Ollama's locally hosted LLM models can be used.

### Streamlit Framework
Built using Streamlit, LegalInsight provides a seamless and interactive experience, allowing for rapid development and deployment of data-driven web applications.

### PDF Processing
The app utilizes `PyPDF2` to extract text from PDF files, which is then fed into the NLP pipeline for analysis.

### AI-Powered Strategy Generator
LegalInsight suggests potential strategies by comparing the current case with past judgments, providing actionable insights that could influence judicial decisions.
